This file contains the Raw data of the multiple experiments contained in the Thesis "Reliable IoT networks utilizing 
UAVs" by Casper Sonne, Viktor Egesby and Olivier Jarrosson.

The only modification the data has had outside of the attached "plotter.py" file is removing remenants of previous 
experiments as well as removing rows of measurement taken before both the node and relay are connected.

Description of the files:

-RelayCal.txt		File containing the calibration of the 1 meter measurement for the second iteration 
			experiment of the next 3 files

-Drone.txt		Drone perspective of the second iteration of the evaluation experiment, containing RSSI 
			relay->node, relay->root, aswell as the calculated distance from said RSSI values 
		
-puttyWith.txt		Node perspective of the second iteration of the evaluation experiment, paired with 
			Drone.txt makes a whole set of data of the experiment, it contains package delivery 
			values as well of the RSSI between Node and Root

-puttyNo.txt		Section of the experiment of the second iteration of the evaluation experiment, regarding the 
			base case of the relay not being involved to compare the data obtained from the previous files


-Drone_TX-21.txt	Similar to Drone.txt but regarding the 3rd iteration of the experiment
-TX-21_puttyNo.txt	Similar to puttyNo.txt but regarding the 3rd iteration of the experiment
-TX-21_puttyWith.txt	Similar to puttyWith.txt but regarding the 3rd iteration of the experiment
